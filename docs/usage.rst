=====
Usage
=====

* To use DLITE in a project::

    import DLITE

* To visualize how you can use DLITE, run the example notebooks that are available with the release::

    jupyter notebook 

Here, we provide a brief description of each notebook

*	Generate_Voronoi_data.ipynb

Generate random Voronoi tessellations and save as .txt files in a format required by Surface Evolver. This format is described below::

    STRING/
    space_dimension 2/
    vertices/
      |- ...
    edges/
      |- ...
    faces/
      |- ...
    bodies/
      |- ...
    read
  	gogo/

*	Demo_notebook_SurfaceEvolver.ipynb

Predict tensions in a time-series of synthetic data generated by Surface Evolver. Here, we generate a time-series by stitching together multiple independent Surface Evolver outputs. Each output is a .txt file. For an example of such outputs, take a look at the data in::

	/Data/Synthetic_data

For details on how to run Surface Evolver, refer to the documentation_.

.. _documentation: http://facstaff.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/html/evolver.htm

* 	Demo_notebook_ZO-1.ipynb

Predict tensions in a time-series of ZO-1 data. Here, we take tracing outputs generated by the NeuronJ_ plugin in ImageJ_.

.. _NeuronJ: https://imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/
.. _ImageJ: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/

The outputs generated by NeuronJ are in the following format::

    Tracing N1:/
      |- ...
    Tracing N2:/
      |- ...
    ...

For an example of such outputs, take a look at the data in::

	Data/ZO-1_data

*	Compare_CELLFIT_DLITE.ipynb

DLITE offers you the option to compute tensions using CELLFIT. Compare_CELLFIT_DLITE.ipynb helps visualize the differences between the two methods. Datasets available are those described in our biorxviv_ paper

.. _biorxviv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/541144v2.full

These datasets are organized as::

    Data/
      |- Synthetic_data/
         |- Fig_2/
            |- ...
         |- Fig_3/
            |- ...
         |- Fig_5/

         |- SOM_example_2/
            |- ...
      |- ZO-1_data/

            |- ...
         |- Time-series_3/
            |- ...
         |- Time-series_4/
            |- ...

*	FOV_drift.ipynb

Take a single colony image and split it up into multiple smaller panels so as to simulate field of view (FOV) drift.
