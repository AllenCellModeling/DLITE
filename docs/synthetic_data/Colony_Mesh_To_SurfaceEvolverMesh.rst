Converting a colony mesh to a mesh suitable for use with SurfaceEvolver
=================

Now we have a colony mesh that was generated by a Voronoi tessellation. To use this as a synthetic colony we need to pass it into SurfaceEvolver and find its minimal energy shape. 

This is accomplished with the one-off-command of::

    evolver $NAME.fe

This will launch SurfaceEvolver. Within SurfaceEvolver running::

    gogo3

will both find the minimal energy shape and output a ``.txt`` file that we will use in our next step.
