The physics of tension balance
=================

The model assumes that any given image of a cell colony is quasi-static. This means that we can perform a force balance at every node in the colony. The force balance per node can be written as:

* n<sub>&residual;</sub>(x) = :math:`$\sum_{i} t_{i}v_{i}$` 

$$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2b}.$$

```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
