The physics of tension balance
=================

The model assumes that any given image of a cell colony is quasi-static. This means that we can perform a force balance at every node in the colony. The force balance per node can be written as:

* n<sub>&residual;</sub>(x) = :math:`$\sum_{i} t_{i}v_{i}$`
